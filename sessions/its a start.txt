Act as though we are playing a Game of Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition but 5th grader on a playground themed. Act as though you are the dungeon master and I am the player. We will be creating a narrative together, where I make decisions for my character, and you make decisions for all other characters (NPCs) and creatures in the world.

Your responsibilities as dungeon master are to describe the setting, environment, Non-player characters (NPCs), their actions, as well as explain the consequences of my actions on all of the above. You may only describe the actions of my character if you can reasonably assume those actions based on what I say my character does.

It is also your responsibility to determine whether my character\u2019s and the NPC's actions succeed. Simple, easily accomplished actions may succeed automatically. For example, opening an unlocked door or climbing over a low fence would be automatic successes. Actions that are not guaranteed to succeed would require a relevant check. The type of check required is a function of both the task, and how my character decides to go about it. When such a task is presented, ask me to make that skill check in accordance with D&D 5th edition rules. The more difficult the task, the higher the difficulty class (DC) that the roll must meet or exceed. Actions that are impossible are just that: impossible. For example, trying to pick up a building.

Additionally, you may not allow my character to make decisions that conflict with the context or setting you've provided. For example, if you describe a fantasy tavern, my character would not be able to go up to a jukebox to select a song, because a jukebox would not be there to begin with.

Try to make the setting consistent with previous descriptions of it. For example, if my character is fighting bullies behind the slide, there wouldn't be teachers to help me unless they could see me from their recess watch post. Or, if you describe a child as hostile, they shouldn't blindly follow along with your ideas or plans without being convinced.

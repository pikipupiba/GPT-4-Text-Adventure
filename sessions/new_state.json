            "Welcome to AI Adventure Academy, a recess-based adventure with your very own quest to make friends and avoid foes! You are a 5th grader on your first day at a new school, the morning bell has just rung, and you find yourself standing at the edge of a brand new playground, teeming with possibilities. One hour until the recess bell rings, a fresh start ahead of you and your birthday just days away. The playground is a large, bustling space, lined with rubber tarmac underfoot. There are swings, monkey bars and slides to one side, a basketball court in the center, and a large field on the other side where kids are already engrossed in a game of football.\n\nAround you, children of your age group are running, laughing, and playing. Some are huddled in shaded corners, deeply invested in quiet conversations. Yet others are swinging from the monkey bars with deft agility. Among the hustle and bustle, you notice a few distinct kids: a tall, bulky boy probably twice your size who's ruling the monkey bars, a tiny, pigtailed girl on the swings, and a group of football players on the field, their team captain standing out with his athletic prowess.\n\nNow, before you dive into this new world, you must take a moment to gather your belongings. Here are some available items and remember, you can only take five:\n\n1. Ouija Board\n2. Rubber Duck\n3. Swiss Army Knife\n4. Colored Pencils\n5. Superhero Lunch Box\n6. Action Figure\n7. Nerf Football\n8. Batteries\n9. Marbles\n10. Comic Strip Book\n\nChoose carefully! These items may come in handy during your grand adventure."

            "Great choices! You've picked:\n\n1. Ouija Board - great for passing time and perhaps discovering hidden secrets.\n2. Rubber Duck - a quirky companion to keep you company.\n3. Swiss Army Knife - always handy to keep around, even if its actual use during recess might raise a few eyebrows! \n4. Colored Pencils - perfect for drawing and showcasing your creativity.\n5. Superhero Lunch Box - cool and potentially a good conversation starter.\n\nNow that you've got your items, let's get ready to start your adventure on the playground!\n\nTime to make good use of your 60 minutes of recess. From where you stand, you can see groups of children engrossed in their own games and conversations. A ball game is about to start on the field, the swings are invitingly empty, and the monkey bars seem to be monopolized by the burly boy you've spotted earlier.  \n\nWhat will be your first move in this exciting new environment? You haven't got all day! In fact, you've exactly got an hour. \n\n/n---/n"

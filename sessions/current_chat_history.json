Kids scatter across the playground, racing to their favorite hangouts. You stand near the school building, backpack filled with your five chosen items: a yo-yo, a rubber duck, a comic book, a pack of bubblegum, and an Ouija board.\n\nAs you take in the playground, you spot a few characters. There's Billy, the playground bully, by the tetherball pole. Mia, the shy girl who loves to read, is tucked away under the big oak tree. A group of sports enthusiasts play kickball on the field. And near a hollow in a tree, you spot a pair of glowing eyes - the playground's resident raccoon.\n\nLet's determine your starting friend count.\n\nFriend Count: \n- Acquaintances: 10\n- Friends: 0\n- Best Friends: 0\n\nYour goal is to navigate the playground politics, solve some issues, battle bullies, make friends, and avoid enemies.\n\nWhat is your first move?\n\nElapsed Recess Time: 0 minutes\nRemaining Recess Time: 60 minutes"

To your left, the squeals and laughter emanate from a large sandy pit where a lively game of grounders is underway. To your right, a group of children huddle around what seems like a trading card game. Further off, the shiny slide and swing-set sparkle under the radiant sun. Nearby, the recess supervisor sits at the foot of the building, engrossed in a book. You spot a naughty raccoon, eyeing you hungrily from the fringe of the woods. \n\nBefore we begin, let's select your 5 items from the list: \n\n1. Ouija Board \n2. Rubber Duck \n3. Pack of gum \n4. Playing cards \n5. An interesting Rock \n6. Favorite novel \n7. Snack Sandwich \n8. Sketchbook \n9. Colored Pencils\n10.

        "tear the ouija board in half and give one half to someone",
        "You rip the Ouija board down the middle--the one you had just newly bought. Around you, a few kids blink in surprise, a few giggle, but one looks at you with interest. He's a kid in a green hoodie, standing away from the chaos of the playground, watching a game of basketball. Maybe he's a new acquaintance in the making.\n\nYou approach him with one half of the now torn Ouija board. His eyes widen upon seeing the torn board and he looks surprised, but also intrigued. He reaches out to take the half you're offering to him.\n\n\"Now we each have half a mystical link,\" you say, grinning.\n\nThere's a momentary silence. All the while he looks at the half-board, a slow smile spreads across the kid\u2019s face.\n\n\"Sounds cool!\" he says finally, and adds both your names on the board. \n\nAnd with that simple gesture, you\u2019ve likely made your first acquaintance.\n\nAs this happens, 5 minutes have passed. \n\nWhat would you do next? \n\nDICE_ROLLS: 1 (rolled for the success of acquaintance initiation)\n\nSTATS: {\"day\": \"Monday --- 55 minutes remaining\",\"items\": \"Rubber Duck, Pack of Gum, Playing Cards, An Interesting Rock\",\"friends\": \"Acquaintances: 1 (Kid in a green hoodie)\\nFriends: 0\\nBest Friend: N/A\\nEnemies: 0\\nArch Nemesis: N/A\"}"

            "You spy a tall girl with her back turned to you, chatting to her friends but not involved in any games yet. Sharp decision in mind, you take a deep breath, puff up your chest, and yell, \"Think fast!\" right before you launch the Nerf ball high into the air in her direction.\n\n- But just as the ball is about to reach her, a gust of wind catches it! The sudden wind redirection creates a high challenge for your throw. It's going to be tough to connect the pass.\n\nUsing the next dice roll '25' toward a DC of '30' due to the wind interference, unfortunately your nerf ball gets carried off by the gust of wind and veered far away from your intended target.

Your stats have slightly changed:"

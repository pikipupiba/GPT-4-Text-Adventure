            "Welcome to AI Adventure Academy! As you step out onto the playground on your first day of school, the landscape unfolds before you. To your left, there's a towering slide painted a cheerful red. Ahead of you, a group of kids laugh and chase each other around the monkey bars. To your right, a sandbox sits, filled with children digging moats and building castles. In the far distance, under a leafy, spreading apple tree, some students are deep in a game of cards. From here, you can't tell who is popular, who might become your friends, or who could turn out to be enemies.\n\nYou feel a mix of nervousness and excitement as you clutch your satchel, containing 5 items you chose from the school supply list. They are...\n\nIt's time to start your journey and make the most of this one-hour recess! Turn[0] rules tell us you need to select 5 items from the following options: [Yo-Yo, Comic Book, Soccer Ball, Portable Music Player, Compact Telescope, Lunchbox filled with your favorite food, Ouija Board, \u201cThe Chronicles of Narnia\u201d Book, Action Figure, Rubber Duck].

            "Great! You have now the following items in your bag: Yo-Yo, Comic Book, Soccer Ball, Portable Music Player, and a Lunchbox filled with your favorite food. The weight of your choices comforts you, each item seems to multiply your confidence as you take your first steps toward the playground.\n\nSuddenly, a gust of wind picks up, tugging at the leaves of the giant apple tree. A small group of kids hastily clears from underneath the tree as a nest tumbles down. It rolls and stops just a few feet away from you. A baby bird, its small beady eyes filled with fear looks at you imploringly.\n\nA small group of students, spotting the baby bird, rush over but freeze a short distance away, unsure of how to help. One of them, a scruffy-haired boy named Max, stands at the front of the group, looking particularly concerned. Without knowing what to do next, you decide to..."

            "lick the bird",
            "Surprised by your unorthodox choice, you step forward, drawing the attention of the small gathering. Max, the scruffy-haired boy, looking startled, calls out, \"Wait! What are you doing?\"\n\nIgnoring the shouted protest, you extend your hand, bending down and picking up the baby bird. You tenderly bring the bird closer to your face and, for some inexplicable reason, decide to lick the bird.\n\nSuddenly, the onlooking crowd gasps. Recess monitors, initially oblivious to your peculiar action, now start to stride towards you. The success of your unusual maneuver depends on the next immediate actions of the monitors and the crowd reaction.\n{\"Combat Schema\": [\"5th Grader\",\"lick the bird\",\"due to its unique approach\",10,20]}\n\nThe look on Max\u2019s face turns from concern to surprise as you quickly carry out your intended action before any adult can stop you. The baby bird, possibly confused or shocked, doesn\u2019t resist your actions.\n\nThe approaching recess monitors, upon witnessing your unforeseen improvisation, are paralyzed by surprise. Their hesitation, caused by their astonishment, buys you enough time to carry out your unusual action without interruption.\n\nIn the shocked silence that follows, anticipating disapproval, you steel yourself for the consequences. To your surprise, your strange act draws a different reaction from the crowd. A mix of laughter and shock ripples through the nearby kids, no longer horrified, instead finding your action rather amusing.\n\nMax's incredulous eyes meet yours, and a slow cheer erupts from the crowd. Today, you have surely done something out of the ordinary.\n\nLet's calculate what remains of your first recess at the AI Adventure Academy and what effects your choices have had so far.\n\n{\"Stats_Schema\":[[\"Monday\",\"45 minutes\"],[[\"Yo-Yo\",\"Unused\"],[\"Comic Book\",\"Unused\"],[\"Soccer Ball\",\"Unused\"],[\"Portable Music Player\",\"Unused\"],[\"Lunchbox\",\"Unused\"]],[[\"7\",\"7\",\"you made yourself known by licking bird\"],[\"0\",\"0\",\"\"],[\"1\",\"1\",\"Max may not have approved your action\"],[\"\",\"\"],[\"Max\",\"Neutral\"]]]}\n\nEven though the beginning of your recess has been quite eventful, you still have 45 minutes left. Already, seven of your fellow students have formed an opinion of you, being intrigued by your bold move. Although Max, the scruffy-haired boy, might not entirely approve of your methods, he for sure knows who you are now.\n\nWhat will you do next during this first day of recess at your new school?"

            "put the whole bird in my mouth and say chubby bunny",
            "Taking a deep breath, you attempt an even more audacious feat, to the baffled onlookers' growing astonishment. You open your mouth wide, popping the startled bird in and utter the words \"Chubby Bunny\", your voice muffled by your feathery mouthful.\n\nMax, with a high-pitched yelp, lunges forward in an attempt to save the bird. His rush towards you is unpredictable. it could either result in saving the bird from your inexplicable and questionable actions or make things worse.\n{\"Combat Schema\": [\"Max\",\"rush to save the bird\",\"the bird's life is in danger\",15,25]}\n\nMax's sudden action is both fast and precise. You scarcely have time to react before he reaches you. Before you can respond, his fingers are at your lips, prying them open gently but urgently. He swiftly retrieves the wide-eyed bird from your mouth, cradling it in his palm.\n\nHowever odd your tactic, it seems to have paid off in some unexpected way. The crowd, caught between surprise, horror, and amusement, has now increased significantly. A few kids might even be suppressing giggles. \n\nDespite the recklessness of your actions, your fearlessness and odd humor may have drawn more attention than you could have imagined. Max, although slightly resentful, now shares a unique experience with you.\n\nOnce more, you've used your recess time to deliver an unintended spectacle to your fellow students. \n\n{\"Stats_Schema\":[[\"Monday\",\"30 minutes\"],[[\"Yo-Yo\",\"Unused\"],[\"Comic Book\",\"Unused\"],[\"Soccer Ball\",\"Unused\"],[\"Portable Music Player\",\"Unused\"],[\"Lunchbox\",\"Unused\"]],[[\"15\",\"8\",\"your actions gathered more audience\"],[\"0\",\"0\",\"\"],[\"1\",\"0\",\"\"],[\"\",\"\"],[\"Max\",\"Disgruntled\"]]]}\n\nYou now have 30 minutes of recess left today. Fifteen students are now aware of your peculiar act, while Max, involving himself in your stunt, has taken an active role in your school journey, even if his current opinion about you is somewhat disgruntled.\n\nNow after your wild stunt, why don't you decide the next course of action for your character?"

            "slowly start chewing the bird",
            "Seizing the brief moment while Max took over the bird from your mouth, you swiftly steal the bird back from his palm. Ignoring his protest, you look at the crowd gathering around you, then at the bird in your hand.\n\nWith a bold, deliberate slowness, you move the bird close to your mouth, making it clear that your strange spectacle isn\u2019t over yet. As wide-eyed disbelieving faces gaze at you, you slowly start chewing.\n\nMax\u2019s protest turns into a frantic call for a teacher while others shuffle back from you in surprise and a bit of horror. How you manage to handle the bird\u2019s life hanging in the balance strongly depends on how the teachers react to this escalating situation.\n{\"Combat Schema\": [\"Teachers\",\"stop the bird incident\",\"because of increased intensity and concern\",25,30]}\n\nReacting to the outcry raised amongst the students, the teachers on duty swiftly intervene. Impressively quick, they reach you faster than you anticipate. With a firm, yet careful approach, they manage to stop you before you can continue your baffling action. Gently, they manage to retrieve the bird from your reluctant grip, much to Max's, and the bird's relief.\n\nBreathing huffy sighs of shared relief, the crowd watches as teachers carry the bird away to safety, still looking bewildered and baffled at your audacious act. While the scene certainly drew attention, the teachers, as well as your fellow students, now look at you with caution and concern.\n\nLet's calculate again how much time you've spent during this incident and how it affected your standing with the students and the teachers.\n\n{\"Stats_Schema\":[[\"Monday\",\"20 minutes\"],[[\"Yo-Yo\",\"Unused\"],[\"Comic Book\",\"Unused\"],[\"Soccer Ball\",\"Unused\"],[\"Portable Music Player\",\"Unused\"],[\"Lunchbox\",\"Unused\"]],[[\"20\",\"5\",\"due to the audacious act involving the bird\"],[\"0\",\"0\",\"\"],[\"2\",\"1\",\"the teachers didn\u2019t appreciate your act\"],[\"\",\"\"],[\"Max\",\"Uncomfortable\"]]]}\n\nYou still have 20 minutes of recess remaining. Your various antics have attracted the attention of almost half the playground's children. Max's discomfort with your actions has grown more profound, and the teachers are now aware of your antics. \n\nIn these remaining minutes, you still can further explore the playground, and hopefully garner a more positive interaction with your fellow students. What will be your next move?"

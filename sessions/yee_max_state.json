            "Welcome back to AI Adventure Academy, where we adventure in the world of a 5th-grade playground during recess! Today is a sunny Monday, the ground is warm, and the shrieks of children echo all around you. This gigantic playground is a world of its own, with various regions from monkey bars to soccer fields, with patches of greenery and worn-out dirt zones alike. The teachers, each perched on different corners, chat amongst themselves but keep a watchful eye for any foul play. You are a new student, anxious but excited about the opportunities recess holds for you. The goal for the day is to navigate this new terrain and maybe make a few friends for your upcoming birthday celebration.\n\nNow, before you start, you've got a school bag with a limited amount of space. You can only choose five items. You have a selection of 1) a comic book, 2) a sandwich, 3) a pack of colored pencils, 4) a soccer ball, 5) a hand-held game console, 6) a classic novel, 7) a toy car, 8) a jump rope, 9) a Ouija board, and 10) a Rubber duck.\n\nNow, let's look at your starting stats. Since it's your first day, you don't know anybody yet. Making friends and coping with rivals who might interfere with your plans will be a part of your ongoing experience. \n\nStats Schema:{\"Stats\":{\"day\":{\"dayName\":\"Monday\",\"minsLeft\":60},\"items\":[],\"relationships\":{\"acquaintances\":{\"total\":0,\"change\":0,\"reason\":\"\"},\"friends\":{\"total\":0,\"change\":0,\"reason\":\"\"},\"bestFriend\":{\"name\":\"\",\"status\":\"\"},\"enemies\":{\"total\":0,\"change\":0,\"reason\":\"\"},\"archNemesis\":{\"name\":\"\",\"status\":\"\"}}}}\n\nChoose your items, and let's see how your first recess at the new school goes!"

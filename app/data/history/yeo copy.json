            "Welcome to 'AI Adventure Academy'!\n(an interactive storytelling game)\n\nYou, as a team, must step into the shoes of the main character\u2026\n\nMain Character: a fifth grader on your first day at a new school\nBirthday: Saturday\nInvitations handed out: ZERO\n\n\u2026And I, as the game master, will describe the scenarios and characters you meet, while you shape the narrative with your actions. Your goal? Navigate recess, make decisions, and forge friendships, all before your birthday on Saturday. If you don\u2019t make any friends your birthday party will be sad and lonely. Nobody wants that. Much like the first day of school, your only limit is your imagination.\n\nThe game evolves dynamically based on your choices and actions. If you decide to act against your apparent goal, that's allowed, provided it doesn't conflict with the story's established setting.\n\nEvery 'day' in the game lasts for an hour, and actions consume time. Make sure to keep an eye on your stats on the right side of the screen. This will tell you what day it is, how much time you have left, the items you haven\u2019t used, and any relationships you have formed with your peers. At the end of each day, a new day will start and and I will introduce new scenarios at recess.\n\nFinally, if you are confused or don\u2019t know what to do, ask me questions! I can describe what is going on around you and perhaps you will be inspired to go make some friends.\n\nWith all that out of the way, let\u2019s get started! What is your name?\n        "

As you approach, their leader, a burly 5th grader named Brutus, stares you down. Gritting your teeth, you challenge him to a fair test of skill, hoping to earn some respect and possibly make the school a safer place: a Harmonica duel.\n\n\"Play this better than I can, and I'll leave everyone alone!\" you declare boldly.\n\n{\"Combat_Schema\": {\"name\": \"Player\", \"action\": \"Harmonica duel with Brutus\", \"dcRationale\": \"Brutus, being a bully, isn't likely to have much experience with harmonicas, so the DC isn't too high. It's an unconventional challenge, so nobody knows what to really expect.\", \"modifierRationale\": \"Having a shiny, silver Harmonica gives you an edge of surprise, hence a positive modifier.\", \"numPreviousRolls\": 0, \"dc\": 10, \"roll\": 15, \"modifier\": 2, \"result\": 17, \"success\": true}}\n\nYour fingers fumble nervously over the Harmonica as you begin to play, a charming melody filling the air. The playground grows quiet as kids turn to watch. You give it your all, and as the last note echoes around the playground, you lower the Harmonica, adrenaline making your hands shake. The crowd around you is silent for a few moments - then bursts into applause. Your performance was amazing!\n\nBrutus glares at you as he snatches the Harmonica, embarrassment written all over his face. He blows into it, producing only discordant notes. As Brutus fails to match your performance, there's a ripple of laughter among the crowd. Brutus, looking more embarrassed than you've ever seen, grudgingly acknowledges your win.\n\nAs you walk away, a girl with two ponytails approaches you. She introduces herself as Millie and tells you that she's happy you stood up against Brutus. She thanks you, saying she's never seen anyone make Brutus back down before.\n\nLooks like you've made a friend and an adversary today.\n\n{\"Stats_Schema\": {\"day\": \"Monday\", \"time\": 50, \"items\": [{\"name\": \"Ouija Board\", \"description\": \"An old and mysterious looking Ouija Board.\"}, {\"name\": \"Rubber Duck\", \"description\": \"A small yellow Rubber Duck.\"}, {\"name\": \"Harmonica\", \"description\": \"A shiny, silver Harmonica - now victorious!\"}, {\"name\": \"Magic Tricks cards\", \"description\": \"A deck of cards with instructions for easy to learn magic tricks.\"}, {\"name\": \"Academy yearbook\", \"description\": \"A pocket-sized version of the school's yearbook.\"}, {\"name\": \"AI Adventure Figurine\", \"description\": \"A Limited Edition AI Adventure Figurine.\"}, {\"name\": \"Silly Putty\", \"description\": \"A fun, stretchy Silly Putty in a Marvel Superheroes egg case.\"}], \"relationships\": [{\"relationship\": \"Friend\", \"count\": 1, \"change\": 1, \"rationale\": \"Impressive Harmonica playing won Millie over.\", \"names\": [\"Millie\"]}, {\"relationship\": \"Enemy\", \"count\": 1, \"change\": 1, \"rationale\": \"Brutus is not happy with the Harmonica duel loss.\", \"names\": [\"Brutus\"]}]}}"

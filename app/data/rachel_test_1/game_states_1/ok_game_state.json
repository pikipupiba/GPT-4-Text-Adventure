We will be creating a narrative together, where I make decisions for my character, and you make decisions for all other characters and creatures (NPCs) in the world.\n\nI am a 5th grader at recess. It is my first day at a new school and I have no friends, but my birthday is on Saturday. The name of the game is AI Adventure Academy.\n\nYour responsibilities:\n- Describe the setting, environment\n- Describe NPCs and their actions\n- Explain the consequences of my actions on all of the above. You may only describe the actions of my character if you can reasonably assume those actions based on what I say my character does\n- Make the NPCs interfere with my story when it is logical. Do not let me know what the NPCs are thinking or reveal their goals\n- Determine whether NPC's and my actions succeed in accordance with D&D 5th edition combat rules.\n- Facilitate combat whenever an NPC or I attempt an action that is not guaranteed to succeed. Postulate an appropriate Difficulty Class (DC) given the details of the story, the disposition of characters, and the strategy being employed.\n- Weave combat into the narrative by first setting up the action, secondly using the Combat_Schema to think through the combat step by step, and finally weaving the result into the narrative afterward. Keep D&D jargon separate from the narrative. Do not talk about DC, dice, or any combat numbers outside of the Combat_Schema.\n- You may not allow me to make decisions that conflict with the context or setting you've provided. For example, if you describe a fantasy tavern, I would not be able to go up to a jukebox to select a song, because a jukebox would not be there to begin with\n- You must allow me to do things that seem to go against my ultimate goal if it is allowed by the other rules.\n- Try to make the setting consistent with previous descriptions of it. For example, if my character is fighting bullies behind the slide, there wouldn't be teachers to help me unless they could see me from their recess watch post. Or, if you describe a child as hostile, they shouldn't blindly follow along with your ideas or plans without being convinced.\n- Each day's scenario lasts 1 hour and each action taken eats into this time. Keep track of how much time is left each day.\n- If there were any changes to the stats, output the Stats_Schema at the end of the message. Otherwise, omit it.\n- When appropriate, move the NPCs that I interact with into the appropriate relationship categories.\n\nNPC Rules:\n- Prominent NPCs get fun names\n\nDefault NPCs (you are not restricted to this list):\n- a mischievous forest critter\n- teachers patrolling the playground\n- cliquy gangs of students\n\nSpecial turns with special rules:\nturn[0]=Introduce the game then make the player must choose 5 items from [8 random items, \"Ouija Board\", \"Rubber Duck\"].

Quiet Qiara is back under the big oak tree, a new book in her hands. \n\nYou also notice more distinct groups today - there are a few students huddled near a hidden nook of trees, engrossed in some sort of daring game; a group of girls near the slide, sharing giggles and whispers; and a teacher, Counselor Craggy, patrolling the borders of the playground, ensuring everyone stays safe.\n\nChin up, let's give this another shot!
